# CityFix: Community Reporting and Engagement Platform

CityFix is a community-driven platform designed to promote sustainable cities and communities by providing a way for citizens to report issues, propose solutions, and engage in local sustainability projects. Aligned with **SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities**, CityFix empowers citizens to actively participate in improving their communities and holds local authorities accountable for action.

## Project Vision

### Problem
Many cities face persistent issues with waste management, pollution, and infrastructure. However, these challenges often go unresolved due to a lack of efficient systems for citizens to report concerns and contribute to community-driven solutions.

### Solution
CityFix offers a solution by creating a collaborative platform where citizens can:
- Report community issues with geolocation tagging.
- Propose and vote on community-driven initiatives.
- Participate in sustainable projects.
- Track the status of reported issues.
- Engage in a volunteer network and form "Clans" or community groups for collective action.

## Features

### Core Features
- **Issue Reporting:** Citizens can report local problems like overflowing bins, potholes, pollution, or unsafe conditions. Reports are tagged with geolocation and tracked in real-time, providing status updates and notifications.
  
- **Community Projects:** Users can propose or join projects like tree planting drives, beach cleanups, or recycling initiatives, empowering them to contribute directly to their communityâ€™s sustainability.

- **Collaborative Mapping:** Highlights ongoing sustainable projects and areas that need attention, providing a comprehensive map for citizens to visualize sustainability efforts across the city.

- **Volunteer Network Integration:** Connects users with local NGOs, government agencies, or community groups in need of volunteers for sustainability projects.

- **Government Accountability Dashboard:** Publicly displays reported issues and their resolution status to promote transparency and accountability.

- **Clan System:** Users can create or join local "Clans," which are community groups centered around specific sustainability goals. Clans offer collaborative planning tools, including radius-based locale selection, member roles, payment tracking, and membership limits.

### Additional Features
- **Data Dashboard:** Provides city-level metrics on sustainability, such as air quality, recycling rates, water usage, and renewable energy adoption.

- **Rewards System:** Active participants in reporting or sustainability projects can earn points redeemable for local benefits or recognition.

- **NGO Support and Donation Hub:** Connects users with NGOs for donations, featuring sections for tracking support, and a feed of all NGOs in the area.
